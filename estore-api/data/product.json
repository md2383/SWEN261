While the video quality is decent, with HD resolution and clear image, the audio quality leaves a lot to be desired. The built-in microphone is not up to par, and the audio sounds muffled and distant. The webcam itself is a bit bulky and lacks flexibility in positioning, making it challenging to find the perfect angle. I found the software interface to be clunky and not very user-friendly. Overall, I was disappointed with this product because of its subpar audio quality, limited flexibility, and software issues. It's okay for basic video calls, but not recommended for those looking for high-quality audio and advanced features.","rating":2},{"productid":23,"userid":6,"review":"As the Dark Knight, I, Bruce Wayne, require high-quality video communication for my covert operations, and the Logitech C920 HD Pro Webcam gets the job done. The image quality is decent, with sharp details and good color accuracy. The built-in microphone provides clear audio for video calls and online meetings. The adjustable clip makes it easy to attach to my laptop or monitor. However, the autofocus can be slow and sometimes struggles in low-light conditions. The field of view could be wider for better framing in video calls. The software can be clunky, and the settings interface could be more user-friendly.
